# Domain: Projects and Initiatives

**Purpose:** Defined bodies of work with owners, participants, timelines, deliverables and status.

**Domain type:** Entity
**Note subtype:** `project-initiative`

## Operating instructions

1. Read this file before creating or updating records in this domain.
2. Use a flat namespace unless a future accepted governance decision authorises dated subfolders.
3. Resolve aliases and existing identities before creating a new record.
4. Link every imported fact to its Source and retain the internal source locator.
5. Multi-value relationships should be represented as explicit links or indexed relationship records, not duplicated embedded entities.
6. Actions, commitments and business decisions are structured attributes of this activity and are indexed for retrieval; they are not standalone entities.

## Production record requirements

All canonical records must contain the approved type-specific ID and name fields plus `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `status`, `aliases`, `tags`, `confidence`, and `sourceRefs`. Relationships are typed fields compiled into the generated query index. The machine-readable schema under `schemas/` is authoritative.

## Record template
